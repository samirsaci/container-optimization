### Medium Article
In this [Medium Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/maximize-the-loading-capacity-of-a-sea-container-to-reduce-your-shipping-costs-with-python-8cc02c9725a7), we will build a container loading optimization 
model using a heuristic method from a Python library.


### Experiment
#### Scenario
You need to load in a 40' Container
- 20 European Pallets 80 x 120 (cm)
- 4 North American Pallets 100 x 120 (cm)
#### Tentative 1: The Intuitive solution

> Results: 20/20 Euro Pallets loaded, 2/4 American pallets loaded. You need another container for the two remaining pallets.
#### Tentative 2: The Optimization Algorithm Result

> Results: 20/20 Euro Pallets loaded, 4/4 American pallets loaded. You donâ€™t need another container.
